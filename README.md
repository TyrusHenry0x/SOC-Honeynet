# SIEM Lab: Mapping Windows Logs in Azure Sentinel

## Overview
In this lab, I set up a system to collect logs from both a **Windows 10 virtual machine** and a **Linux virtual machine** visualizing my windows machine in Azure Sentinel, and to display the vulnerabilities of using a linux machine without hardening and securing it. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with SIEM tools, log analysis, and threat detection while building a practical security monitoring solution.

## Lab Setup
### **Tools & Technologies Used:**
- **Azure Sentinel** â€“ Cloud-native SIEM for log analysis and security monitoring
- **Log Analytics Workspace** â€“ Stores and processes log data
- **Windows Event Logs** â€“ Provides system, security, and application logs
- **Linux Logs via SSH** â€“ Demonstrates security vulnerabilities on an unprotected Linux machine
- **GeoIP Data Mapping** â€“ Translates IP addresses into geographic locations

## Implementation Steps
### **1. Setting Up Virtual Machines**
I created two virtual machines:
- **Windows 10 VM**: Configured to collect security event logs and forward them to Azure Sentinel.
- **Linux VM**: Used to demonstrate how attackers attempt to access an unsecured system.

For the Windows machine, I modified its **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to make it vulnerable by deleting RDP restrictions and allowing all incoming traffic. I also disabled the **Windows Defender Firewall** to simulate an unprotected system. 

The Linux VM was used to showcase how easily an attacker could target an exposed system by observing authentication logs.

### **2. Configuring Log Collection**
#### **Windows Machine:**
- Enabled **Windows Security Event Auditing** for both successful and failed logins.
- Used **Event Viewer** to verify failed login attempts (Event ID: 4625).
- Installed the **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** to forward logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace** (since the Log Analytics Agent was deprecated).

#### **Linux Machine:**
The Linux system was not connected to Sentinel but was used to demonstrate how vulnerable it is by default.
- Accessed logs using SSH: `$ ssh labuser@[linux machine public ip]`
- Navigated to log directory: `$ cd /var/log/`
- Inspected authentication logs: `$ cat auth.log`
- Filtered login attempts using: `$ cat auth.log | grep password`

This showed how quickly attackers attempted to log in to an unprotected Linux system.

### **3. Ingesting Logs into Azure Sentinel**
- Created an **Azure Log Analytics Workspace** and connected it to **Azure Sentinel**.
- Enabled **Windows Security Events via AMA** within Sentinel's **Content Hub**.
- Configured a **Data Collection Rule** to ingest security logs from the Windows VM.
- Verified log ingestion using KQL queries in **Log Analytics**.

### **4. Visualizing Attack Sources on a World Map**
To map failed login attempts geographically:
- Created a **Geo-IP Watchlist** in **Sentinel**.
- Queried failed login attempts using **KQL** to extract IP addresses.
- Mapped IPs to geographic locations.
- Created an **Azure Workbook** using the following **JSON query** to visualize attacks on a heatmap:

```json
{
  "type": 3,
  "content": {
    "version": "KqlItem/1.0",
    "query": "let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist(\"geoip\");\nlet WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent;\nWindowsEvents | where EventID == 4625\n| order by TimeGenerated desc\n| evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)\n| summarize FailureCount = count() by IpAddress, latitude, longitude, cityname, countryname\n| project FailureCount, AttackerIp = IpAddress, latitude, longitude, city = cityname, country = countryname,\nfriendly_location = strcat(cityname, \" (\", countryname, \")\");",
    "size": 3,
    "timeContext": {
      "durationMs": 2592000000
    },
    "queryType": 0,
    "resourceType": "microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces",
    "visualization": "map",
    "mapSettings": {
      "locInfo": "LatLong",
      "locInfoColumn": "countryname",
      "latitude": "latitude",
      "longitude": "longitude",
      "sizeSettings": "FailureCount",
      "sizeAggregation": "Sum",
      "opacity": 0.8,
      "labelSettings": "friendly_location",
      "legendMetric": "FailureCount",
      "legendAggregation": "Sum",
      "itemColorSettings": {
        "nodeColorField": "FailureCount",
        "colorAggregation": "Sum",
        "type": "heatmap",
        "heatmapPalette": "greenRed"
      }
    }
  },
  "name": "query - 0"
}
```

The resulting **heatmap** displayed attack origins, with major brute-force attempts coming from **Poland, Belgium, and Argentina**.

## Key Takeaways
- **Security Risk Awareness**: An unprotected system receives thousands of attack attempts within minutes.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Worked with Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics, and KQL.
- **Log Analysis & Visualization**: Mapped real-world attack attempts using GeoIP data.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Log Analytics Agent Deprecation**: Solved by switching to **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)** and configuring Windows Security Events in Sentinel.
- **Data Collection Rule Setup**: Required learning Sentinel's new data collection process.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Automated Incident Response** for detected threats.
- Set up **Real-Time Alerts** for brute-force attempts.
- Expand the lab to simulate a **full Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow.

ðŸš€ This project significantly improved my understanding of **SIEM, cloud security, and log analysis**. Next, I plan to integrate **incident response mechanisms** and further automate security monitoring!
